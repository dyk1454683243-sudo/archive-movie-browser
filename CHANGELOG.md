# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), newest first.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Cookieless usage analytics (Vercel Web Analytics): page views and a few events such as a film played. See Privacy in the README.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Our own film player: arrow keys skip 10 s (Shift: a minute), Space pauses, F is full screen, M mutes, Escape closes, and a film resumes where you left it. Archive.org's player remains the fallback ([#137](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/137)).
- An MCP server for the catalogue, run locally ([#112](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/112)) or hosted at `/api/mcp` ([#133](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/133)), with a page explaining it ([#130](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/130)).
- Decade filter, 1910s to 2020s ([#128](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/128), [#132](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/132)).

- Grid or list view is remembered between visits ([#110](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/110)).
- A security policy with private vulnerability reporting ([#113](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/113)).

### Changed

- Release-date sorts leave out dates that are really upload dates, so "newest" is truthful ([#128](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/128), [#132](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/132)).
- Most Popular shows films with a real poster first ([#132](https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser/pull/132)).
