**Live demo:** https://archive-movie-browser.vercel.app

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Famponce%2Farchive-movie-browser)

It runs without any configuration. For movie posters, add `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` in your Vercel project's environment variables and redeploy.

## Features

- **Browse the Internet Archive's films** - A front end to Archive.org's video collections: it shows what Archive.org hosts, with better search, filtering and posters
- **Real posters, no key needed** - A poster index maps messy Archive.org uploads to the real film, so most films show their TMDB poster with no API key; the rest get a designed cover
- **Genre Filtering** - Filter by Horror, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Drama, and more
- **Smart Search** - Suggestions as you type, matching titles, subjects, and creators across every collection at once
- **Shareable views** - Filters, searches and films all live in the URL, so any view can be bookmarked or sent to a friend
- **Embedded Player** - Watch movies directly in the browser without leaving the site
- **Movie Details** - View cast, director, ratings, runtime, and plot synopsis
- **Related Movies** - Discover similar films based on genre
- **Responsive Design** - Works great on desktop and mobile devices, keyboard and screen-reader accessible
- **MCP server** - Let an AI assistant search and recommend the films ([mcp/](mcp/README.md))
- **Persistent Cache** - TMDB data is cached locally for faster subsequent loads

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Modern React with hooks
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **Archive.org API** - Movie data and streaming
- **TMDB API** - Movie posters and metadata

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm or yarn
- Optional: TMDB API key for movie posters (free at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amponce/archive-movie-browser.git
cd archive-movie-browser
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Add your TMDB API key to `.env`:
```
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

![Archive Movie Browser](https://archive.org/services/img/feature_films)


### Browsing Movies
- Use the genre pills to filter by genre across all the film collections
- Toggle between "Full Movies" and "Shorts" for different content types
- Adjust minimum runtime with the duration filter
- Sort by popularity, rating, newest, or alphabetically

### Searching
- Type a title, subject, or creator in the search box and press Enter or click Search
- A search looks across every collection, not just the selected one, and matches all the words you type
- Search results show all matching movies regardless of TMDB poster availability or missing runtime data
- Empty the search box or pick a category to return to browsing mode

### Watching Movies
- Click any movie card to open the detail page
- Click "Watch Now" to start the embedded Archive.org player
- Browse related movies at the bottom of the detail page

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY` | Your TMDB API key for movie posters | No (recommended) |

### Without TMDB API Key

The app works without a TMDB API key:
- Films in the [poster index](#poster-index) still show their real poster; the rest get a generated cover
- Films outside the index are not matched live, so fewer of them have posters
- No cast, director or TMDB ratings on the detail page

## Poster Index

Archive.org titles are messy (`H 2 House On Haunted Hill ( 1959) Classic Vincent Price Horror Full Movie`), so matching them to TMDB in the browser misses a lot. `public/poster-index.json` holds decisions made offline instead: for the most-downloaded uploads in each film collection, which TMDB film it is, or that it is none. The app checks the index first, so indexed films get real posters **with no TMDB key and no TMDB requests**, and anything not indexed falls back to live matching.

- Build or extend it with `npm run index` (options are in the header of `scripts/build-poster-index.mjs`). It needs a TMDB key and an OpenRouter key in `.env.local`; see `.env.example`. A decision is permanent per Archive.org identifier, so reruns only pay for new uploads. 750 uploads cost about 3 cents.
- The decisions come from a small decision model (`typesafe/jev-1.13`), which picks among the TMDB candidates we fetch and reports a confidence. Below 0.7 the app shows the generated cover instead: a wrong poster is worse than none. On a hand-labelled set of 80 hard search results this got 67 right with 0 wrong posters, against 43 right and 5 wrong for the in-browser heuristics.
- A scheduled workflow refreshes it weekly and pushes the result to a branch for review.
- **Found a wrong poster?** Edit that identifier's entry in `public/poster-index.json` and open a PR. Setting it to `{ "n": 1, "c": 1, "m": 1 }` means "show the generated cover"; `"m": 1` marks an entry as corrected by hand, and the build script never overwrites those.

## MCP Server

`mcp/` is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server built on the same Archive.org code as the site, so an AI assistant can search the films, browse collections and hand back links that play. Four tools, no API keys. Setup for Claude Code, Claude Desktop and Cursor is in [mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md).

## Make It Yours

Fork it and turn it into your own themed archive: only westerns, only Prelinger educational films, only silent comedies.

- **Collections** - edit `VIDEO_CATEGORIES` in `src/services/archive.js`. Each `id` is an Archive.org collection identifier, the last part of a URL like `archive.org/details/Film_Noir`.
- **Default collection** - change the initial `category` state in `src/components/ArchiveMovieBrowser.jsx`.
- **Genres** - edit `STANDARD_GENRES` and `GENRE_ALIASES` in `src/services/archive.js`.

All Archive.org access goes through `src/services/archive.js`, which has no React or DOM dependencies, so it can be reused outside this app.

## Privacy

The live site uses [Vercel Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics): no cookies, no user identifiers, nothing sold or shared. It counts page views and a few events (a film opened or played, ten minutes watched, a search, a filter change) so we can tell whether people find and watch films. Search text is sent in lowercase, cut to 60 characters, with anything that looks like an email address removed. The code is in `src/services/analytics.js`; a fork only collects anything if its owner enables Web Analytics on their own Vercel project.
